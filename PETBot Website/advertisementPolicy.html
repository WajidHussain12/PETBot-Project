            <div class="policies">

                <p>
                    1) All advertisements and commercially sponsored publications are independent from editorial
                    decisions.
                    BMC
                    does not endorse any product or service marked as an advertisement or promoted by a sponsor in BMC
                    publications. Editorial content is not compromised by commercial or financial interests, or by any
                    specific arrangements with advertising clients or sponsors.</p>
                <hr>

                <div class="adimgsresponsive">
                    <img src="images/Policy Imges/ad1.jpg" alt="">
                </div>

                <p>2) BMC reserves the right to decline any type of advertising that is damaging to the brand of BMC or
                    is
                    inappropriate to the content held on the BMC network.</p>
                <hr>

                <p>3) BMC will not accept advertising for products or services known to be harmful to health (e.g.
                    tobacco
                    and
                    alcohol products).</p>
                <hr>


                <p>4) Advertisements may not be deceptive or misleading, and must be verifiable. Advertisements should
                    clearly
                    identify the advertiser and the product or service being offered. Exaggerated or extravagantly
                    worded
                    copy will not be allowed. Advertisements will not be accepted if they appear to be indecent or
                    offensive
                    in either text or artwork, or if they relate to content of a personal, racial, ethnic, sexual
                    orientation, or religious nature.</p>
                <hr>

                <div class="adimgsresponsive">
                    <img src="images/Policy Imges/ad2.jpg" alt="">
                </div>



                <p>5) Once an advertisement has been deployed online, it will be withdrawn from the journal site at any
                    time
                    if the Editor(s)-in-Chief or Publisher request its removal.</p>
                <hr>


                <p>6) BMC will not allow any treatment-specific or drug-specific campaign to be targeted to a specific
                    article(s) or on any page where content relates to the product(s) being advertised. (Advertisers may
                    not
                    link to articles using keywords; they may not target advertising for a specific product on the
                    condition
                    that it appear in the same location and at the same time as a specific article mentioning that
                    product
                    and they may not refer to an article published at the same time as the advertisement appears).</p>
                <hr>
                <div class="adimgsresponsive">
                    <img src="images/Policy Imges/ad3.jpg" alt="">
                </div>


                <p>7) All advertisements for drug-specific campaigns must comply with the relevant European and UK
                    legislation
                    that regulates advertising. Information about the latest legislation, as well as good practice
                    guidelines, can be found on the MHRA website. . Advertisers should make available to BMC the
                    marketing
                    authorization and summary of product characteristics when submitting their advertisement. In the
                    case of
                    drug advertisements, the full generic name of each active ingredient should appear. Each page of an
                    advertisement for a prescription-only medicine should be clearly labeled as intended for health
                    professionals.</p>
                <hr>


                <p>8) All advertisements for drug specific campaigns should encourage correct and rational use and must
                    not
                    be
                    misleading.</p>
                <hr>


                <p>9) Advertisements and editorial content must be clearly distinguishable. BMC will not publish
                    “advertorial”
                    content, and sponsored supplements must be clearly indicated as such. If a supplement did not
                    undergo
                    peer review or underwent a peer review-process different from the rest of the journal that should be
                    explicitly stated.</p>
                <hr>


                <p>10) Editorial decisions will not be influenced by current or potential sponsors and advertisers, and
                    will
                    not be influenced by marketing decisions. Advertisers and sponsors have no control or influence over
                    the
                    results of searches a user may conduct on the website by keyword or search topic.</p>
                <hr>
                <div class="adimgsresponsive">
                    <img src="images/Policy Imges/ad4.jpg" alt="">
                </div>


                <p>11) If any advert is requested outside of BMC standard advertising positions then a request should be
                    made
                    to editorial who will respond with a full and final decision within two business days.</p>
                <hr>


                <p>12) Information about complaints concerning advertisements will be included in the Advertisements
                    page.
                </p>
                <hr>
