                    <p class="qp">
                        <Span class="pet">PETBOT</Span> Bottle offers a wide selection of water bottle materials. Each
                        carries its own
                        advantages and disadvantages. While it's true that manufacturing and shipping custom water
                        bottles has an impact on the environment, any of our material choices are far more
                        environmentally friendly than the alternative: single use bottled water.

                        So, how do you know which water bottle material option is best for your custom water bottles?
                        We've prepared this guide to help you in your decision! P.S. Since all <Span

                    <p class="qp">
                        Stainless steel water bottles and aluminum water bottles often look and feel similar. However,
                        there are major differences between the two. We've outlined the pros and cons of stainless steel
                        vs aluminum water bottles here. Whichever type you choose, remember to wash your bottles every
                        day.

                    <ul class="pul">
                        <li> 1) Over time, repeated hot water machine-washing can cause the imprinted artwork on your
                            bottle
                            to fade, peel, or crack.</li>
                        <li> 2) The rubber and silicone seals used to keep liquids in the bottle can break down and
                            cause a leak.</li>
                        <li> 3) Even the best dishwashers usually can't get the insides of water bottles as clean as a
                            bottle brush and elbow grease.</li>

                    <p class="qp">
                        Glass is the only water bottle material besides Tritan copolyester that is dishwasher safe. You
                        may put your glass bottles in the dishwasher or hand wash them with hot water and dish soap. If
                        your glass water bottle has a lid with a rubber or silicone gasket, or a silicone wrap, we
                        recommend hand washing that part to maintain the integrity of the material.

                        We recommend that you wash stainless steel water bottles by hand (with hot water and dish soap).
                        Using a long-neck brush will ensure the inside of your bottle is getting clean. Baby bottle
                        brushes work great!

                    <p class="qp">
                        The term cream and economy mostly refer to it's shape. While both glass jars are round in shape,
                        cream jar comes with a straight-sided wall all the way to the neck opening, with the neck
                        diameter equal to the widest point of the jar. Economy jars and sample jars, on the other hand,
                        has a shoulder where the opening of the jar is narrower than the overall diameter of the jar

                    <p class="qp">The estrogenic activity of mineral waters was examined in several studies with cell
                        culture
                        test systems and in one test on snails. Estrogenic activity was detected in several cases, but
                        it was approx. 10,000 times lower than the natural estrogenic activity of beverages such as
                        milk, beer or red wine.

                    <p class="qp">Antimony compounds can be used as catalysts in the manufacture of PET. Antimony has a
                        very low estrogenic effectiveness. Concentrations of up to 2 micrograms of antimony per litre
                        have been detected in mineral water.

                    <summary>Are plasticisers contained in PET bottles?</summary>
                    <p class="qp">When consumers hear the name “polyethylene terephthalate”, they often think of
                        phthalates,
                        which are used as plasticisers. One of the reasons why phthalates are a repeated topic of
                        public discussion is that several of them have hormone-like effects, but phthalates and other
                        plasticisers are not used in the manufacture of PET bottles.
